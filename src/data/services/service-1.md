    <h3>Real Estate Industry â€“ M K Relators by Anil Das Construction Pvt. Ltd.</h3>
    <p>At Anil Das Construction Pvt. Ltd., we take our commitment to development very seriously. Three years ago, we expanded our horizons by venturing into the real estate sector under the esteemed banner of M K Relators. Our initial project was a significant milestone: a development of 130 flats located at Beharbari on the National Highway. We are proud to report that this project was completed on schedule and all units were successfully handed over to satisfied customers.

Building on this success, we undertook two additional residential projects in Mirza. These projects comprised two buildings, each containing 10 high-quality flats.

To date, our portfolio in the real estate sector has seen the completion of over 150 flats, with more than 130 units already handed over to our valued clients. This track record reflects our dedication to delivering quality and excellence in every project we undertake.!</p>
