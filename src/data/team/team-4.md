### Words from our director



"Dreams fueled with passion can transform into reality." This philosophy has been vividly embodied by Mr. Anil Das, the visionary behind AD Construction Pvt Ltd (ADCPL). With unwavering dedication, hard work, motivation, and a positive outlook, he turned a modest beginning with just ₹14,400 in 1988 into a respected empire built on love, goodwill, and trust.

Mr. Das's journey from his hometown of Mirza to becoming a business tycoon is marked by relentless perseverance and resilience. He never yielded to challenges; instead, he shaped his destiny with each determined step. From being a national athlete in long and triple jump, his competitive spirit has transitioned into the business world, where he now contributes as the VP Finance for the Assam Rifle and Shooting Association.

An eternal learner, Mr. Das continually adapts to the evolving world, embracing changes that propel ADCPL forward. His social nature and focus on human connections over mere economic gains have made him a pillar of support in his community. He invests in people, helping them strive and thrive, driven by the belief that everyone is born with a purpose.

"I am a simple person who believes nothing is impossible," Mr. Das shares. "While I've faced failures, I have never given up, driven by the conviction that we are all destined to fulfill a purpose. Punctuality, patience, and perseverance—my three P's—have guided my life and are values I strive to impart to others. Success is not static; it demands continuous effort and aspiration for excellence."

ADCPL is not just a company, but a family of dedicated professionals who believe in their expertise and aim for excellence. As the company expands into new ventures, including a significant foray into tourism with a planned 5-star hotel project, ADCPL proudly embraces this new chapter, ready to set new benchmarks in the industry.
